Airbnb generates vast amounts of data that can be harnessed to gain insights into customer behavior, host performance, and make informed business decisions. This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset consisting of approximately 49,000 observations and 16 columns, containing a mix of categorical and numeric values, to uncover key understandings about Airbnb bookings.
